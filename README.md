# College_Is
This is the College Management System for College.
I worte this college Mangement System in Java using NetBeans. 
In this Project there are 2 classes(one class for storing colleges data and another class for providing user guide.)

We can add college id, college Name, Category, Fee, and other data releted to college in this system which is shown in given below. And after storing the data the data are stored in external file from which the data is extracted in tabel shown at the bottom of the IS interface.

College Information System:
